START = """You wake up lying on a circular opening in a murky dark forest. Long menacing spruce trees stand tall like pillars of the sky.
The forest around you has an ancient and eerie aura. You get a sense the surrounding trees are watching you intently as you stand up and dust yourself off.
A lonely crow flies past your head. 

Looking around, you notice a collection of natural boulders, old and weather as they appear.
The ancient stones form a circle around where you are standing. On the mossy ground lies two items of interest.
And empty flask and an amulet of iron made in the likeness of a sitting bear.
You decide to take these items and head from the safety of the small opening into the world of darkness that awaits you under the shadows of those ancient green wardens.

HUNTER = """You wander aimlessly amidst the giant trees for what feels like an eternity.
Then suddenly out of the corner of your eye, you spot the crow from before, gliding past you to sit on a nearby branch.
It cocks its head and looks at you with a piercing gaze, stopping you in your tracks. You feel a powerful inner pull and urge to follow it. 
The crow flutters from branch to branch leading you deeper into the heart of the forest, before finally disappearing mysteriously into the fog.
Looking around for it, you find instead a warm, soft, cozy light seeping through the treebranches, inviting you to approach. 
Coming closer you notice a small cabin nearby and a man sitting on the porch, busy at work. The man looks up at you with smiling eyes.
He tells you he is a hunter who is on his way to check on a few traps that he set. He invites you to join him for a meal and allows you to stay the night in his cabin, if you so choose.
Before the man leaves he tells you there's stew in the pot waiting for you.
He begins to part again, then abruptly turns “Oh, I almost forgot! I lost an old iron necklace in the woods a couple of days ago. Perhaps you have seen it?”

SHOW_AMULET = """You show him the amulet you found laying on the ground near where you awoke a couple of hour ago. He takes the amulet from you and examines it keenly.
Then he turn his head towards you with a faint smile on his lips. \"it is indeed my amulet there is no doubt about that, but perhaps it was not mere chance that you should happen upon it.
i think you ought to keep it. it has kept me safe all these years and perhaps it provides the same service for your sake. Take it i insist!\" he presses the amulet firmly in your hand.

ASK_AGAIN = """Are you sure you haven't seen my amulet? It is quite heavy iron amulet shaped in the likeness of a sitting bear,
quite easily recognizable. It has sentimental value to me. I like to think it has kept me safe all these years. i'd very much hate to lose it?

SHOW_AMULET_2 = """It is my amulet thats for sure. You hesitated in giving it a stranger but still decided to do so. Thank you.

INVITE = """Oh... well you must be hungry come inside we can talk more over some delicious stew. The man motions you to follow as he enters the rustic old wood cabin.
\"Please take a seat, i'll fix us some stew.\" He takes two bowl of meat stew from the large pot that is simmering above a fireplace and places them on the table.
\"Please help yourself for some stew.\"

TALE = """The man takes a seat in front of you and looks up at you. \"So, you probably wonder where you are? This here forest is known as the Darkwood largest forest in the kingdom.
It's probably two to three days of travel west before you come upon a nearest village. People don't like to settle too close to it, They say the forest is cursed.
Village folks talk that Druids inhabit these woods. I haven't seen any of the sort since i moved here, plenty of animals to hunt and a boat load of piece and quiet on the other hand.\"

DINNER = """After dining with him them man gets up and informs you that he will be gone for a few days. He tells you he's going to check on a few traps he set a while ago.
